A browser-based 3D Mardi Gras parade simulator (React + R3F + Howler) – catch throws, compete with bots, and enjoy the parade.

## Quick links
- Game Design Document (GDD): [docs/GAME_DESIGN.md](./docs/GAME_DESIGN.md)
- Quick launch page (auto-generated by the share helper): [docs/launch.html](./docs/launch.html)
- In-game bot config: `client/src/config/bots.json`

## Quick start (dev)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server (Vite + Express):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the game in your browser: http://localhost:5000

## Quick share (one-click public dev)

Use the included PowerShell helper to start the dev server and a temporary public tunnel (Cloudflare `cloudflared` recommended):

```powershell
# From project root (PowerShell):
Unblock-File .\scripts\start-cloudflared-oneclick.ps1; .\scripts\start-cloudflared-oneclick.ps1
```

The script will start `npm run dev`, open a tunnel, write `docs/browser-qr.svg`, and open the public URL in your browser — share that URL with testers.

## Public playtest (temporary)

- Open this redirect page (auto-updates after running the share helper): [docs/launch.html](./docs/launch.html)
- Latest public URL (plain text): `docs/last-public-url.txt`
- Quick QR for mobile: `docs/browser-qr.svg`

Note: These are ephemeral. Run the one-click helper above to refresh the public link.

## Logo assets

- To import a local PNG logo into the docs: `node scripts/import-logo.js "C:\path\to\logo.png"`
- To generate icon sizes (favicons, thumbnails): `node scripts/generate-logo-sizes.mjs`
- Embedded SVG is output to `docs/images/logo-embedded.svg`

## Contribution & governance
See `docs/` for design, technical docs, and contribution guidelines.
