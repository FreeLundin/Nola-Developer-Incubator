g # Archived: Unreal Conversion Plan

This document archives the Unreal Engine conversion plan and related native-game notes. The Unreal plan has been moved out of the active documentation while the team focuses on the web React implementation.

Why archived
- The project is focusing on the web React + Three.js implementation for now.
- Unreal-specific plans and instructions are retained for historical/reference purposes.

Where the original content lived
- `docs/archive/README_OLD.md` — previously contained the dual-platform (Web + Unreal) plan.

If you need the full Unreal plan
- Open `docs/archive/README_OLD.md` in this repo (it still contains the historical content), or check the project history in Git for older revisions.

Contact
- If you want the Unreal plan restored to the active docs, open an issue: https://github.com/FreeLundin/Nola-Developer-Incubator/issues
